Work Journal
----

- how do you keep track of all the things you do while working on a project?
- sometimes you are faced with a bug and you think _"I'm sure we fixed this once before, I wish I could remember what we did last time.."_?
- this is especially important when working in a remote team, because you may not have the option of interrupting your teammates and asking them.
- so we know that people should take notes and document what they're doing, but a problem here is that we often don't know what information will be relevant or useful until later.
- the solution we are proposing is to record as much as possible, and discover the relevant parts later.
- however there is tension: you musn't sacrifice your own train-of-thought in order to take notes.
- our challenge is to provide a frictionless way to take notes so that you can do it without thinking too much or interrupting yourself.
- the part of your brain that critiques and categorizes is a flow-killer. We can't engage this part of the brain while taking notes.
- this has a couple of implications:
 - write in a "journal" style. This means you're writing to yourself, not to your teammates. You never have to consider _"will they find this relevant or useful?"_ and you don't have to engage the critical mind.
 - you shouldn't have to think about which file to write in, what tags to use, or how to format it. Just write. All of those things can be done later.
- keeping a journal does take a bit of practice, but after a little while it becomes second nature. And if done right, it will free up your brain to stay "in the flow" while also providing clues for yourself and others to retrace your steps later on.
