Distributed Teams
====

- challenging thoughts here: <https://medium.com/about-work/c0715b8a7c93>
- some good insights about some of the problems distributed teams face, and some ideas on how to solve
- one thing that stood out to me as signficant: do people in the team have a productive way to disagree?
 - Some people have a personality that allows them to disagree with ease, but it's not always productive.
 - Other people might not be the sort to speak up if they feel it puts them on the spot.
 - In any case, we want people to be able to voice their concerns or gut feelings when they see something happening and it doesn't sit right. This is hard enough to get right in person. We need new strategies for doing it remotely.
