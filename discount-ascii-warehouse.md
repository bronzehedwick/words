Draft

Finding the right people is not easy.

I'm not even close to being an expert in this area, but over the last few months I've been involved in critiquing and interviewing dozens of developers for several positions. This has been a learning experience for me so I wanted to pass some of that on. In particular:
- use testing bias to your advantage
- understand the core qualities you're looking for
- make it fun

Hiring Techniques
----

Common techniques:
- language trivia quiz
- fizzbuzz
- github resume
- OS contribution

- One of the things I've always loved about frontend web development is the open-ness. If you have a web browser and a text editor, you have your workbench and tools and can start tinkering.

- I like the "open source" approach because it gives you a first-hand experience of what this person is like to work with. But I think this only really works in certain situations, and it can sometimes come off like you're asking people to work for you for free, while you dangle the carrot of potential employment.

- So I tried to replicate that approach, but with a project ridiculous enough that nobody would ever make money off it regardless of how much "free work" we got. Thus was `discount-ascii-warehouse` born.


Testing Bias
----

- first step: understand that every approach has its own implicit bias.
- If you need someone who can solve algorithmic puzzles under pressure, while someone else looks over their shoulder, and their job is on the line, then by all means make this part of your interview process! Otherwise, it may still be useful but don't forget to adjust for bias.
- solving puzzles under pressure, and recalling random pieces of language trivia (without having to double-duck it) can be useful skills to have at times, but they are not what I'd consider core qualities for the positions I've had to fill.


Core Qualities
----

So then what are the core qualities I was looking for in this exam?

- human skills. Ability to communicate and deliver something that a human will use.
- technical skills. Not abstract or theoretical, but real make-it-work ability.

Just like the "OS contribution" approach, I'm getting an experience of what it's like to work with this candidate.  If I come to the end of the exam and interview feeling like this person is someone I would enjoy working with, that's pretty much all I need to know.


How to evaluate human problem solving skills?
----

- slightly vague requirements (do they ask for more info?)
- leave some requirements open-ended (eg. UI). Are they able to make something simple and user-friendly without specific direction?
- see how they communicate beyond the code itself (eg. describing design decisions / tradeoffs they made)
- leave room for initiative (did they deliver the bare minimum? Or did they add some special touch?)
- revisions (are they able to respond well to feedback?)

How to evaluate technical skills?
----

- use a scorecard so that you can compare candidates on a fairly consistent baseline
- be prepared to iterate on both the scorecard and the exam as you go


Highlights from discount-ascii-warehouse
----

I was really pleased to see so many candidates who, even after hearing that they wouldn't proceed to the next round of interviews, came back saying they had fun completing the exam. I think this is important. You're asking people to give up some of their free time, possibly for nothing in return.  So don't ask them to make yet-another-todo-list.  Or if you do, put a fun spin on it (like if you complete 3 todo items in 20 seconds you get a "combo" bonus). Little twists like this also help separate the good from the great.

Sticky points:
- infinite scroll with pre-fetching
- sorting
