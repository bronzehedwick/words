Maintenance
====

Here's a great post by Jim Bird about maintaining software: [http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2013/07/maintaining-software-sucks-and-what-we.html]().  Here are some notes & inspired off-shoots from that:

- Maintenance is **hard**.

- It requires a different set of skills, you have to work really hard to understand the mind of the author.  And if you're maintaining a project that has had multiple authors over time it's like interviewing someone with split personality disorder.

- It also requires a huge amount of humility.  It's way to easy to conclude _"the author was clearly an idiot, I would have done it better."_  As soon as you give in to this mindset you'll never have the patience it takes to learn something new.

- It's counterproductive to say _"maintenance sucks"_ because if you want to do anything worth doing, it's going to need to be maintained.  Instead we need to change the way we think about maintenance, being smart about it, humble and patient.
