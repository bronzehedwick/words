Iterations
====

- every iteration ends in a release. So we define an iteration by what will be launched at the end of it.
- we'll often start an iteration with some level of uncertainty, so one of the first things we need to do is to remove as much uncertainty as possible. If we discover information along the way that challenges the assumptions this iteration was based on (eg. _"this is going to be much more complicated than we first thought"_, or _"there is clearly a better way to do this"_), it can be good cause to scrap it and start a new iteration.
- iterations can be any length of time. Shorter is better.
