Testing VS Automation
----

I feel like automation doesn't get talked about enough, and that it's actually the more important ingredient for quality than simply writing tests. When people talk about "testing" it often gives the impression that it's something you do *after* you've finished building the software.  Automation is a core attribute of the software: it either has it or it doesn't. Writing tests for software that doesn't have automation built in is the equivalent of _"will it blend"_ or poking an animal with a stick to see what will happen. You might get some results but they won't tell you everything you need to know.

Automation is more than Convenience
----

At first glance automation seems all about convenience. Remember those old-timey movies of the guy turning the crank shaft to make the car start? We just press a button and the car comes to life like magic.

Automation is about so much more than convenience: it raises you to a new level and allows you to do things you couldn't do before.

Sticking with the car example, consider manual and automatic transmission. Driving an auto means you have one free hand to hold your drink. You can still do that in a manual but when you want to change gears it can be tricky-and-or-dangerous, let alone the risk of spilling hot coffee on your lap.

But testing and automation are definitely linked. The engineers desiging an automatic car can run tests for changing gears, without needing someone to sit inside and move the stick. The automation makes it testable.
