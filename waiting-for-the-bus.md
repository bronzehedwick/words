Waiting for the bus
====

You're waiting for the bus.  It should have been here by now but it isn't.

You could walk.  It would be a long walk but at least you know you would get there and how long it would take.  And you would get exercise.  But yeah, long walk.

Waiting 5 more minutes.  Maybe there aren't any busses today??  Or maybe you'll see it rushing past after you've finally given in and walked a block.

When you have a destination to reach, indecision is a killer.  Having two good options before you, choose one and go for it with conviction, making the most of it.  It's too easy to constantly second-guess and miss out on the best of either.
