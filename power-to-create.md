Power to create
====

Listening to [Aral Balkan on Digital Feudalism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QCBzQ0aNc) and [Amber Case on The Open Web](http://vimeo.com/77352414) remind me of when I first "got" the web and have wanted to be a part of building it ever since. Whatever else it may be, the web is an amazing publishing platform where anyone can create, interact and share. It's a maker's dream: no expensive licenses or regulating bodies, and raw materials are free.  All you need is a text editor and your imagination.

Aral talks about how technology gives us superpowers, along with a call to take ownership. Failing to do this means that the more we become dependent on these powers, the less empowered we are by them.

To me the superpower granted us by web is the ability to create and share experiences. It's why I'm part of a team that strives to create a [culture of superheroes](http://x-team.com/2013/09/why-we-embrace-a-culture-of-superheroes/) and spend my days empowering the people we work with to create great experiences.

But just like any good superhero plot the main stuggle happens within, as we learn to use the power for good. Anything good also be turned to cause great harm, and we have enough sci-fi movies to show us how technology out of control can get scary. Start small and simple in this discovery and remind yourself what is good, empowering and constructive. As Amber puts it, _"Learn again how to post content and be creative and build stuff"_.
